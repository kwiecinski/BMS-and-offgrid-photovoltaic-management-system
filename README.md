## PV panels connection and DIY Ground Mount structure 
The photovoltaic modules I used in my PV installation are Trina Solar TSM-245. These are used panels that I purchased for around $40 each. The installation consists of 8 modules connected in series.

## BMS for lead-acid batteries
BMS have several tasks:
- Battery Balancer equalizes the state of charge of two series connected 12V batteries. If one of battery is overcharged it discharge it using resistor.
- Bidirectional DC-DC converter - protect battery from too much discharge or charge current
- Battery monitoring - measurment of temperature of each battery and voltage.

The BMS is controlled by an AVR64DD28 microcontroller. To program it, you need a programmer that supports UPDI.
I'm using SerialUPDI (a modified version with high-voltage programming capability and galvanic isolation, which you can find here: SerialUPDI link).

To measure battery voltage and current, I use the INA226 sensor along with the built-in ADC of the microcontroller.

The INA226 measures:

- The voltage of the entire battery pack, split into BATT_LOW (bottom battery) and BATT_HIGH (top battery)

- The voltage across a shunt resistor, used to measure the current flowing through the entire pack

Since the INA226 is bidirectional, it allows both charging and discharging current measurements.

The microcontrollerâ€™s ADC measures only BATT_LOW voltage.
By subtracting the ADC reading from the INA226â€™s total voltage reading, I can calculate the BATT_HIGH voltage.

Cell balancing is performed using high-power resistors, each connected in parallel with a battery cell.
Each resistor is switched by a MOSFET, which is controlled by the MCU using PWM.

PWM is hardware-generated using the TCD timer, which controls two outputs: WOA and WOB, each assigned to a specific MCU pin.

The TCD timer is capable of generating...

## PV panels connection and DIY Ground Mount structure 

### 1. Photovoltaic modules
The photovoltaic modules I used in my PV installation are Trina Solar TSM-245. These are used panels that I purchased for around $40 each. The installation consists of 8 modules connected in series.

The first stage was marking the mounting points for the mouting base structure. The entire construction has eight support points. After digging holes in the ground, they were filled with concrete, and concrete bases with reinforcement were embedded in them. I had plenty of these as production waste from the company where I work. They are typically used for mounting lightning protection masts on flat building roofs.

Inside each base, there is reinforcement and four M16 threads. I modified the bases by drilling holes on the opposite side, and I welded additional reinforcement to the bottom using scrap metal, which helps to improve the structural stability.

Before mounting the structure to the concrete bases, the contact surfaces were coated with a bituminous compound to prevent corrosion.

Visible in the photo below is a set of four steel mounting bases of varying heights, with welded pipes and mounting plates. Each element was made with consideration for uneven ground, that is why there are different pipe lengths. Each base has a bottom plate with holes for M16 bolts, intended for anchoring to a concrete base. On the table next to them lies a long steel angle bar, which was welded from several sections. After welding, the elements were ground down. The photo was taken after the mechanical work was completed, during surface preparation for painting. 
All the steel used for building the PV mouting structure comes from scrap yard.

Longer mounting base are responsible for the solar incidence angle which in this case is 40 degrees

### 8. Underground Cable Installation and Connection to the Building
To connect the panels, I used AsXSn 4x35 cable and additionally laid an AsXSn 4x25 cable. I found these cables at a scrapyard at a good price, which is why I chose this somewhat unconventional option. Additionally, I installed a gel-filled Ethernet twisted pair cable to allow for potential data transmission if needed.

To connect the AROT 50 (blue) protective pipe with the RL50 pipe (white), I created an adapter using a 3D printer. PETG material was chosen for its weather resistance. The opening in adapter was designed to fit the protective pipe only after heating the adapter. Once cooled, the adapter holds the pipe in place.

## BMS for lead-acid batteries
BMS have several tasks:
- Battery Balancer equalizes the state of charge of two series connected 12V batteries. If one of battery is overcharged it discharge it using resistor.
- Bidirectional DC-DC converter - protect battery from too much discharge or charge current
- Battery monitoring - measurment of temperature of each battery and voltage.

The BMS is controlled by an AVR64DD28 microcontroller. To program it, you need a programmer that supports UPDI.
I'm using SerialUPDI (a modified version with high-voltage programming capability and galvanic isolation, which you can find here: SerialUPDI link).

To measure battery voltage and current, I use the INA226 sensor along with the built-in ADC of the microcontroller.

The INA226 measures:

- The voltage of the entire battery pack, split into BATT_LOW (bottom battery) and BATT_HIGH (top battery)

- The voltage across a shunt resistor, used to measure the current flowing through the entire pack

Since the INA226 is bidirectional, it allows both charging and discharging current measurements.

The microcontrollerâ€™s ADC measures only BATT_LOW voltage.
By subtracting the ADC reading from the INA226â€™s total voltage reading, I can calculate the BATT_HIGH voltage.

Cell balancing is performed using high-power resistors, each connected in parallel with a battery cell.
Each resistor is switched by a MOSFET, which is controlled by the MCU using PWM.

PWM is hardware-generated using the TCD timer, which controls two outputs: WOA and WOB, each assigned to a specific MCU pin.

The TCD timer is capable of generating...
